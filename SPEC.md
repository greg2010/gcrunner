# gcrunner — Technical Specification

> **Status:** Draft v0.1
> **Last updated:** 2026-03-12

## Overview

gcrunner is an open-source, drop-in replacement for GitHub-hosted Actions runners on Google Cloud Platform. It provisions ephemeral Compute Engine VMs on demand, runs the job, and self-destructs — giving teams full `actions/runner-images` compatibility at 80%+ cost savings, especially for startups sitting on $100k–$350k in GCP credits.

### Request Flow

1. A GitHub Actions workflow triggers a `workflow_job` webhook event (action: `queued`).
2. The webhook hits a Cloud Function (HTTP-triggered, Go).
3. The Cloud Function authenticates the webhook (HMAC-SHA256), parses the `runs-on` labels, and translates them into a Compute Engine VM spec.
4. The Cloud Function registers an ephemeral (single-use) just-in-time (JIT) runner for the target repository, then calls the Compute Engine API to create an ephemeral VM with a startup script that:
   - Downloads and configures the GitHub Actions runner agent
   - Connects to GitHub as the registered runner with the JIT config
   - Signals readiness back to GitHub
5. When the VM insert fails, the Cloud Function deletes the runner registration unless a VM with the runner's name exists. A retry that finds the runner name already registered keeps the registration when the VM exists, and otherwise replaces an offline registration.
6. GitHub dispatches the job to the new runner.
7. On job completion, the VM executes a shutdown script that deregisters the runner and deletes itself.

### Completed / In-Progress Hooks

- `in_progress`: No-op in MVP. Future use for monitoring/metrics.
- `completed`: Safety net. If the VM failed to self-destruct, the Cloud Function force-deletes it by instance name (derived from run ID + job ID).

### Infrastructure (Single Terraform Apply)

All infrastructure is deployed via a single `terraform apply`:

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Cloud Function (gen2) | Webhook receiver, VM orchestrator |
| Service Account | Minimal IAM: `compute.instanceAdmin.v1`, `iam.serviceAccountUser` on runner SA |
| Runner Service Account | Attached to VMs. Access to GCS cache bucket, Artifact Registry (future) |
| VPC + Subnet | Dedicated network for runner VMs (or use existing) |
| Firewall Rules | Egress-only by default, no ingress |
| GCS Bucket | Build cache storage |
| Secret Manager Secret | GitHub App private key + webhook secret |

---

## Job Label Configuration

Labels are the primary interface for configuring runners. Following runs-on's proven model, all configuration lives directly in the `runs-on:` field of the workflow file — no external config files needed for basic usage.

### Syntax

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: gcrunner=${{ github.run_id }}/machine=n2-standard-4
```

The prefix `gcrunner=<run_id>` identifies the job as targeting gcrunner. Everything after the prefix is a `/`-separated list of `key=value` labels.

Array syntax is also supported but single-string syntax is recommended to prevent GitHub's label-subset matching from causing runner collisions between jobs (same issue runs-on documents).

### MVP Labels

In MVP, the user specifies an exact GCE machine type. No family prefix expansion, no CPU/RAM ranges, no multi-machine selection logic. The Cloud Function takes the machine type string and passes it straight to the Compute Engine API.

| Label | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `machine` | `n2d-standard-2` | Full GCE machine type name (e.g. `n2-standard-4`, `c3-standard-8`, `n2d-standard-2`). Passed directly to the Compute Engine API. |
| `spot` | `true` | Use Spot VMs. `true` (default), `false` for on-demand. If spot capacity is unavailable, automatically falls back to on-demand. |
| `disk` | `50gb` | Boot disk size (e.g. `50gb`, `100gb`, `200gb`). |
| `disk-type` | `pd-ssd` | Boot disk type (e.g. `pd-ssd`, `pd-balanced`, `pd-standard`). |
| `image` | `ubuntu24-full-x64` | Runner image. Maps to a GCE image family. |

That's it. Five labels.

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Simplest — n2d-standard-2 spot VM, pd-ssd, 50gb disk (all defaults)
runs-on: gcrunner=${{ github.run_id }}

# Specify machine type
runs-on: gcrunner=${{ github.run_id }}/machine=n2-standard-4

# Bigger machine, more disk
runs-on: gcrunner=${{ github.run_id }}/machine=c3-standard-8/disk=200gb

# Budget-friendly with balanced disk
runs-on: gcrunner=${{ github.run_id }}/machine=e2-medium/disk-type=pd-balanced

# Production deploy — no spot, can't risk preemption
runs-on: gcrunner=${{ github.run_id }}/machine=n2-standard-2/spot=false
```

**How spot works in MVP:**

1. By default, all VMs are Spot (`spot=true`). GCP Spot VMs are 60–91% cheaper than on-demand.
2. If GCP cannot fulfill the Spot request (capacity error), gcrunner automatically retries the same machine type as on-demand.
3. If a running Spot VM gets preempted mid-job, GCP gives a 30-second warning. The runner agent catches SIGTERM and the job fails. The user can re-run manually.
4. Zone selection: try each zone in the configured region sequentially until one succeeds.

**Built-in images (MVP):**

| Image ID | Base | Arch | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ubuntu24-full-x64` | Ubuntu 24.04 | x86_64 | Full runner image (matches `ubuntu-latest`) |
| `ubuntu22-full-x64` | Ubuntu 22.04 | x86_64 | Legacy compat |

### Post-MVP Labels

These labels are deferred to post-MVP to keep the initial implementation simple.

| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| `cpu` | Number of vCPUs. Supports ranges (`2+8`). Combined with `machine` family prefix for auto-selection. |
| `ram` | Memory in GB. Supports ranges (`8+32`). |
| `machine` (family prefix) | Accept partial names (`n2`, `c3`) or multi-family (`n2+c3`). Requires smart machine type selection logic. |
| `disk-type` | Disk type: `pd-balanced`, `pd-ssd`, `pd-standard`. |
| `local-ssd` | Attach local SSDs for scratch space. |
| `spot-fallback` | Explicit control over fallback behavior (vs MVP's always-fallback). |
| `retry` | Auto-retry on spot preemption (`when-preempted`). |
| `max-price` | Budget guardrail — max hourly price. |
| `zone` | Pin to specific zone(s). |
| `timeout` | Max job runtime in minutes. |
| `debug` | Pause before first step for SSH debugging. |
| `extras` | Feature flags: `gcs-cache`, `docker-cache`. |
| `runner` | Reference a reusable runner profile from `.github/gcrunner.yml`. |
| `image` (ARM) | ARM images (`ubuntu24-full-arm64`) for `t2a` family. |

## VM Lifecycle

### Boot Sequence (~25s target)

1. **VM Created** — Compute Engine API returns, VM starts booting.
2. **Startup Script Runs:**
   a. Set hostname to `gcrunner-{run_id}-{job_id}`
   b. Pull runner config from instance metadata (repo, token, labels)
   c. Download GitHub Actions runner agent (cached in GCE image for fast boot)
   d. Configure runner as ephemeral (`--ephemeral` flag)
   e. Register with GitHub (`config.sh`)
   f. Start runner (`run.sh`)
3. **Runner Ready** — GitHub dispatches the job.

### Shutdown Sequence

1. Job completes → runner agent exits.
2. Shutdown script runs:
   a. Upload any cache artifacts to GCS (if `gcs-cache` enabled)
   b. Deregister runner from GitHub (safety, ephemeral runners auto-deregister)
   c. VM calls `gcloud compute instances delete --quiet` on itself
3. If self-delete fails, the Cloud Function's `completed` webhook handler force-deletes after a grace period.

### Zombie VM Protection

Multiple layers prevent orphaned VMs:

1. **Self-destruct on job completion** (primary)
2. **`completed` webhook force-delete** (secondary)
3. **VM `timeout` label** — max runtime, VM auto-terminates via metadata-based watchdog
4. **Terraform-managed Cloud Scheduler** — periodic sweep that deletes any gcrunner VM older than `max_vm_age` (default: 6 hours)

---

## Security Model

- **Webhook authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 verification of all incoming webhooks.
- **Minimal IAM**: Cloud Function service account has only `compute.instanceAdmin.v1` on the runner subnet, `iam.serviceAccountUser` on the runner SA. Runner SA has only GCS access (cache bucket) and `compute.instances.delete` on itself.
- **Ephemeral runners**: Every VM handles exactly one job. No shared state between jobs. No persistent disk reuse.
- **No ingress**: Runner VMs have no public IP by default (configurable). All communication is outbound to GitHub and GCS.
- **GitHub App scoping**: The GitHub App only needs `actions:read` and `administration:write` (for runner registration). No code access.
- **Secrets in Secret Manager**: GitHub App private key and webhook secret stored in Secret Manager, not in Terraform state.
